## Applications in geoscience: good repo references to start
* Ryan Mardani's [facies classification with ML](https://github.com/mardani72/Facies-Classification-Machine-Learning)
* SEG 2017 [ML contest](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest)

## Resources that I use to learn coding ML from scratch:
* Jason Brownlee's Machine Learning Mastery
* Youtube channels: Weight and Biases, Python Engineer, sentdex
